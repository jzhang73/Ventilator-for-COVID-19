# Ventilator-for-COVID-19

**Open source ventilator designs for patients with COVID-19**

This project is tasked to design a low-cost, open source, simple, easy-to-build and easy-to-use ventilator that can serve COVID-19 patients in an incubation period. With the earlier peak of this pandemic, hospitals ran out of ventilators, and several automobile companies were forced to stop production of their auto-parts and divert their resources to the manufacturing of ventilators. This resource diversion was still hard on them and the result of production was low. Our mechanical ventilator design can help in these critical situations.
A mechanical ventilator is a machine that assists or replaces spontaneous breathing. There are two main types of mechanical ventilation including positive pressure ventilation where air is pushed into the lungs through airways and negative pressure ventilation where the air is usually sucked into the lungs by stimulating the chest movement. With the rise of COVID-19 cases, there is a crucial need to design a simple, low cost mechanical ventilator that is easy to manufacture to help hospitals in hotspot regions that are overwhelmed with new patients. In this project, we present our development of a simple, low-cost mechanical ventilator that performs similarly to conventional commercial medical devices. One of the objectives of this project aimed at supporting the treatment of coronavirus in regions where ventilator supplies are limited. In this project, we focused on refining, evaluating and testing the design of a mechanical ventilator that meets the demands of end users. The design files are available at Github for open access. In parallel to the mechanical assembly of the ventilator, we developed a SolidWorks model to understand the motion mechanisms in the ventilator, which can help to further optimize the system. Finally, with this project, we hope to serve as a backup plan to handle the expected surge of COVID-19 patients who may need breathing assistance in hospitals across the nation.
